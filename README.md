# AgeCalculator (Assembly)
### Implementation
This text based program utilizes assembly programming to calculate the age a person will turn in the year 2023. While using the program the user is prompted to enter the birth year. The result will display the age the person will turn by the end of 2023. If a year in the future is entered, user will be prompted to enter another birth year. User may also continue the program as many times as needed.

The idea behind this age calculator was for use in the pharmacy setting. Often times, we have to calculate the age of a patient to determine the accurate medication dosing protocols. Being able to quickly calculate the age a patient in the retail and hospital pharmacy settings is vital to ensure proper patient care. In our current pharmacy system, it takes 2-3 additional steps to find the patient age, and therefore having a program that can quickly display this information is helpful.
